# 1. Introduction
How to solve $P:min_{x\in D}f(x)$
> [!tip]
> 1. Dierent algorithms can perform better or worse for dierent problems P (sometimes drastically so)
> 2. Studying P through an optimization lens can actually give you a deeper understanding of the task/procedure at hand
> 3. Knowledge of optimization can actually help you create a new problem P that is even more interesting/useful

For convex optimizaiton problems, local minima are global minima
