Systems operating in **wideband channels** have some important properties:
- They suffer from [[Inter Symbol Interference (ISI)]]. This can be most easily understood from the interpretation of [[Delay Dispersion]]. If we transmit a symbol of length $T_{s}$, the arriving signal corresponding to that symbol has a longer duration, and therefore interferes with the subsequent symbol.
