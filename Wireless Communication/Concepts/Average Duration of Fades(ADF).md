Another parameter of interest is the Average Duration of Fades (ADF). 

In the previous sections, we have already derived the rate at which the field strength goes below the considered threshold (i.e., the [[Level Crossing Rate (LCR)]]), and the total percentage of time the field strength is lower than this threshold (i.e., the cdf of the field strength).

The ADFs can be simply computed as the quotient of these two quantities:
$$
ADF(r)=\frac{{cdf_{r}(r)}}{N_{R}(r)}
$$
